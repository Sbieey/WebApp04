              <h1>Hi, thanks for visiting my site.</h1>
              <p>With our 5years development experience in a number of industries i realised that the typical product creation process
                 between clients and developers was flawed. All too often developers rarely communicate to clients throughout the development stage,
                  resulting in a final product that fails to reach the goal sought by the customers and end users.</p>

              <p>For the reason i decided to utilize a completely different development pattern that focuses on highly focused communication and transparent design patterns.
                 When i take a project not only do i work to craft the application according to the clients specification.
                  i give daily updates to ensure that the project is aligning  properly with the clients goals. The end result is the product delivered on time, and on budget.</p>
